Description: Description
        ===========
        
        This package contains a collection of common benchmark problems for black-box
        optimization. Under the term "black-box problem", we understand problems for
        which only little is known about their structure and properties. Such problems
        usually appear in practice when simulator output or some other complex system
        with nonlinear behavior is to be optimized.
        
        Contained test problems:
        
        * Binary problems OneMax, LeadingOnes, and LeadingOnesTrailingZeros and three
          instance generators for multimodal problems
        * CEC 2005 collection of single-objective problems
        * CEC 2007 collection of multiobjective problems
        * Dixon-Szeg√∂ collection for global optimization
        * DTLZ problems 1-7
        * Multiple-Peaks Model 2
        * Walking Fish Group (WFG) toolkit
        * ZDT collection for multiobjective optimization
        
        Contained real-world problems:
        
        * Configuration of a gradient method on test problem
        * Uniformity optimization of points in the unit hypercube
        
        
        The infrastructure of this package can also be used to wrap your own
        (real-world) optimization problems in the problem base class. Reasons to do
        this may be the following features:
        
        * Support for single-objective and multi-objective problems
        * In general, no assumptions about the search space are made
        * Evaluations are automatically counted
        * Can use true parallelism or concurrency via multiprocessing(.dummy)
        * Provides functionality for checking bound constraints and repairing
          violations of them in continuous optimization
        * Optionally: detection and subsequently avoidance of duplicate evaluations
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Some modules of this package have additional dependencies on third-party
        packages. However, these are not enforced during installation not to hinder
        the utilization of the base module, which will always be free of dependencies.
